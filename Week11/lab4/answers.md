q1:
In the react programming language, a state is an object that is used to store data about a component. When a component's state changes, a new rendering of the component is produced.
Props are pieces of data that are passed between React components. These props cannot be changed; they can only be read. You must alter the state of the components sending the props if modification is to be implemented utilizing props.

q2:
A functor is a data structure which can be mapped over by a function. It accepts a parameter and a function, and for each element of the parameter that is supplied into it, it calls the function.

q3:
Callback functions have the benefit of allowing you to wait for the outcome of a function call before immediately executing another function call after it.
Callback functions have the drawback of not scaling well with asynchronous functions. It reduces the code's effectiveness, readability, and debuggability.
Promises have the benefit of handling asynchronous tasks effectively while maintaining legible and troubleshootable code.
Promises have the drawback of only being able to return a single object, which defeats the objective of asynchronous non-blocking input and output.
The benefits of using streams include handling and processing continuous data, data whose size is unknown, and data whose arrival time is likewise uncertain, such as movies.
Streams have the benefit of efficiently allowing you to transfer large amounts of data.
One drawback of streams is that using them to handle single requests or other straightforward situations is a cumbersome solution; promises would be more effective in these situations.

q4:
The box model talks about the design and layout in a website. The box model is a box which encapsulates every HTML element. The box model of 4 parts the margin, border, padding and content.

The margin is an empty section right outside the border.
div {
margin: 20px;
}

The border is a border which surrounds the padding.
div {
border: 15px solid black;
}

The padding is an empty area which surrounds the content.
div {
padding: 20px;
}
